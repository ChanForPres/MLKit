# [WIP] MLKit (a.k.a Machine Learning Kit) ðŸ¤–
MLKit is a simple machine learning framework written in Swift. Currently MLKit features machine learning algorithms that deal with the topic of regression, but the framework will expand over time with topics such as classification, clustering, recommender systems, and deep learning. The vision and goal of this framework is to provide developers with a toolkit to create products that can learn from data. MLKit is a side project of mine in order to make it easier for developers to implement machine learning algorithms on the go, and to familiarlize myself with machine learning concepts.

## Requirements

## Installation

**Example Project Coming Soon!**

MLKit is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'MachineLearningKit', '0.1.3'
```


----------------------------------------------

## Contributing 
The mission of this project is to give developers the ability to create add Machine Learning algorithms to their projects with ease and to enable the creation of advanced projects using the Swift programing language. With this being said, I encourage all developers interested in making Machine Learning accessible to the anyone who works with iOS apps and TVOS apps to contribute to this project. 

To contribute an algorithm **not** currently available within the framework, please create an issue and state what algorithm you have implemented. Make sure that there are unit tests involved where applicable. Also, provide a brief overview of how to use your algorithm. You are also welcome to impelment algorithms within the **Roadmap** section (below). 

To contribute to an already existant algorithm within the framework, please create an issue and state any changes or additions you have made.
